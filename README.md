# Guardian Nexus

The ultimate companion for your Destiny 2 journey. Manage your inventory, track your stats, and optimize your builds.

## ⚡ The Vibe Coding Manifesto

This project is built using 100% Vibe Coding.

I’m leveraging AI-powered development tools (like Cursor and Trae) to bridge the gap between my ideas as a Guardian and the code required to make them a reality. This approach allows me to build features for the Destiny 2 community at the speed of thought, focusing on utility and "vibe" over traditional manual boilerplate.

### 🛠️ A Community Effort

Since this is vibe-coded, the logic can occasionally be as chaotic as a Mayhem match. That’s where you come in:

**Flag the Glitches**: If you find a bug or something feels "off," please open an Issue immediately. Don't worry about being too technical—just tell me what's broken.

**Refine the Vibe**: If you see code that can be optimized, a UI that can be polished, or a feature that needs a better implementation, Pull Requests are highly encouraged.

### 🌌 Why I'm doing this

I am a Data Science student building this for the love of the game. Every contribution, bug report, or bit of feedback doesn't just help me—it helps the entire community. If you think you can make this tool better for our fellow Guardians, I would be incredibly happy to have your help.

Let's build something the Tower would be proud of. 🚀
